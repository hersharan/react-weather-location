# React-Weather-location App
"Create a Search filed that is going to take the name of the city.
    Below the Search box,
    you need to create two containers,
    on the left it should make a Weather API call to
    return the current weather as well as the forecast
    for the week.
    On the right you have to call Google Maps API to show the location on the map and pin it."
